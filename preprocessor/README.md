# Z Open Editor Preprocessor samples

This folder contains examples for running Z Open Editor's preprocessor. They cover running a local sample COBOL and PL/I preprocessor written in Java as well as running preprocessors on z/OS written in REXX. The REXX samples perform the excact some substitution as the Java sample. There is also a REXX example that executes the PL/I compiler to expand PL/I macros that can also be used with the files provided in this repository.

For a detailed tutorial for how to use all these example see [COBOL, PL/I Preprocessor tutorial](https://ibm.github.io/zopeneditor-about/Docs/tutorial_preprocessor.html) in our documentation.

Also review the [Preprocessor user guide](https://ibm.github.io/zopeneditor-about/Docs/advanced_preprocessor.html) with additional information.
